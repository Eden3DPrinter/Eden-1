Project Tesseract

A proposal for the Eden 1 3D printer
------------------------------------

Tesseract: 
"In geometry, the tesseract is the four-dimensional analogue of the cube; the tesseract is to the cube as the cube is to the square."

Outline
-------
As the tesseract is the four-dimentional cube, the Eden 1 is the four-dimentional manufacturing machine. 
The purpose of this is to utilize, on single device, the creative design & physical build process. 

Details
-------
As the tesseract is a smaller cube, inside of a larger cube, the Eden 1 is an FDM 3D printer on the inside, with a full linux-based computer with display on the outside. 
a "three-dimentional computer" if you will. That the use can "reach into" and grab anything they want from the internet. 
a true 3D-TV manifestor. 

This allows the Eden 1 user to design any CAD program, directly on the machine. 
Once designed andfile is sliced, ready to print, simply transfer .stl file to the inside 3D printer, with machine waiting to build your design.



I will add to this, including designs, images and video of what I have built :)
